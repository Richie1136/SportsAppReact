# SportsAppReact

Baseball application built with React.js, using Browser Router to send users to different routes.

Used React hooks - useState and useEffect

Used sportsdata.io api to get the current standings, as well as to get player details and the team component to get the active 26 man roster

This project took me about two weeks to complete.

# Struggles that i encountered

1. It took me some time to find an api that i wanted to use, as i found some that had data but wasn't updated.

2. I struggled a little figuring out the filtered but it turned out much easier then I envisioned
