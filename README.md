# SportsAppReact

I created this project becuase i really enjoy sports and i wanted to continue to get practice working with Apis and to build something that i was passionate about.


This application displays all major league baseball teams with the ability to fetch based on league (AL/NL) or based on division (East/Central/West), as well as information on the name of the ballpark, the location and phone number. Also when clicking on a team inside of the team component, you will get the 26 man roster which will lead to the player details component which will display information such as a photo of the player, the players number, where they were born, when they debuted, the plsyers position, height/ weight, what side of the plate they bat on and throw. 

Finally you could see the most up to date standings of the 2022 mlb season

Baseball application built with React.js, using Browser Router to send users to different routes.

Used React hooks - useState and useEffect

Used sportsdata.io api to get the current standings, as well as to get player details and the team component to get the active 26 man roster


# Struggles that i encountered

1. It took me some time to find an api that i wanted to use, as i found some that had data but wasn't updated.

2. I struggled a little figuring out the filtered but it turned out much easier then I envisioned

3. Trying to get the standings component to look as good as possible and debated weather to have the NL standings underneath the AL standings or to have the NL standings next to the AL standings

In the future i would like to add user auth and add favorites for users
